# api-rest-tours

This is an API developed during a [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman) Node.js course. I was introduced to best practices in backend web development with Node.js and Express, MVC architecture, NoSQL/MongoDB, data modeling, encryption and security tools against the most common attacks, HTTP concepts, server-side rendering, file manipulation with the "fs" built-in module, error handling techniques and more.

The course is still ongoing and among the next lessons to come are: file uploads with Multer, payments using Stripe, pug email templates and email handler.
